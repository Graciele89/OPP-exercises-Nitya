Question 6
Write a program for a lawn-mowing service. The lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks. The weekly
fee for mowing a lot under 400 square feet is $25. The fee for a lot that is 400 square feet or more,
but under 600 square feet, is $35 per week. The fee for a lot that is 600 square feet or over is $50

Question 7
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Ask a user to guess the
random number, then display the random number and a message indicating whether the user's
guess was too high, too low, or correct.
------HINT-------
You can create a random number that is at least min but less than max using the following
statements:
• Random randomGenerator = new Random();
• int randomNumber = randomGenerator.Next(min,max); 1, 11
